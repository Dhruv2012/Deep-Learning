## NOTE ##

For code base/ python files refer this repository (For CustomModel) 

And for all the dependencies/models/big files refer google drive 

The Directory Structure or file structure is as specified in the google drive itself.

## NOTE ##
Another Note regarding code is that some files may contain file path of linux while some of windows as these are performed on 2 difeerent machines So please change the paths accordingly
But the directory structure remains same in both cases
